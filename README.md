This is a script file in R. It processes data collected by the gravity sensor and accelerometer of a Samsung Galaxy S II.
30 Volunteers have participated the experiment. They ve been asked to perform 6 activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking
downstais, sitting, standing, laying) during the which the sensors where measuring. Participants were then randomly divided into
two groups (train and test).
The algorithm in the script joins the two groups into a single dataset and gives as output a final dataset with the mean and
standard deviation of the measurements for each activity and for each participant.
